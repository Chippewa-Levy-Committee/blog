People are quick to jump and make comment when they are mad, but often just want to yell about this or that and not actually work toward an actual solution to meet in the middle of whatever the town is arguing about today. I also think that communication from top down is poor at best. People in our community are completely centered around the rumor mill and what debbie heard sally say about the situation or what they saw on FB versus listening to the leaders elected. On the flip side of the coin, though I do believe that those who go after offices in our town truly care about its improvements I think that often times elected officials choose not to even make comment to address those who have opposing views. They let them talk, but their minds are made up and it's just done to quell the storm and our officials vote how they want, and often times it can easily be seen as elected officials voting for things for themselves, or setting things up so they or their kids benefit more. For example, the .5 MIL improvement plan on the school board was put up for improvements to the schools. However, the school board was silent on the issue of putting into place masks at the beginning of the year which could have allowed the school to apply to get millions in funding to fund several improvement projects and inject that money into our community (especially when they cited that their cash flows weren't where they needed to be because of decisions that were made previously.) However, those elected think/thought masking was dumb, which believe what you want from a political stand point, knowing that a simple policy could have helped fix a ton of our schools maintenance issues was a fiscally irresponsible decision especially when you come up with a levy for it 6 months later. You also have a person who owns a construction company on the board, but I haven't heard anything about him recusing himself from any decisions if the levy should pass because he has an interest in those decisions as company owner who would most definitely want the work. You also have members of the school board who have children who need IEP plans and aids, but when it comes down to making decisions on who gets aids, who gets equipment, etc. will their kids be more important than someone elses when the superintendent follows through on this threat to get rid of bussing and aids? These things breed distrust and failure of levies, and without a leader willing to stand up in the fire, and say you and I don't see eye to eye, this is what I believe, I hear what you're saying, we can come up with a solution that makes us both happy we won't get anywhere. I think that we need more transparency from the school board, monthly open communication sent to every one not just posted somewhere on the website or discussed in the meeting notes...someone truly working to bridge that gap within the community who doesn't feel heard. If you don't have that nothing will change. I don't believe we have that in our superintendent, and I don't believe we have that out of our board (yet). Perception is reality, and the board and the administration has poor perception. Find a way to market and communicate to squash the rumors to ensure that the vast majority is informed and not done so in a condescending way like on social media or just sitting up and listening and poo pooing people when they disagree, actually respond to them and do so in a way where you stop blaming those who don't support your thoughts as the reason, and take ownership of the current perception yourselves as the leaders, and hold yourselves accountable for making actionable change to hear those you disagree with and speak to them not just brush them under the rug.
