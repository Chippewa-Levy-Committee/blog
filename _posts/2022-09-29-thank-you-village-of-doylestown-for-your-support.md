title: Thank you Village of Doylestown for your support
---
We at #OneChippewa want to thank the Village of Doylestown for passing a resolution in support of the levy to renew the 1% School District Income. Having a community working together across the local government, school district, and community groups, helps our community as a town grow stronger. 

There is a saying "A rising tide lifts all boats" - let us together be that tide and rise our community.
