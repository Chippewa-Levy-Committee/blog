In 1999, the Chippewa Chipps football team ended a 29 year drought and won the WCAL title. The work those student-athletes did with long practice hours and mental and physical prepartion was intense, but the payoff was that title and the opportunity to host a home playoff football game versus Martins Ferry.

Only problem was - the field was in such poor condition the OHSAA wouldn't let them, and they had to play in Wooster instead.

Our girls and boys soccer teams have had similar issues over the years - robbing our student-athletes the opportunity to play in games in from of thier community outside of the stadium they called home, that no doubt have had impacts on thier lives on and off the field.

As many of us in Doylestown plan today to the head to the stadium that has been part of our community for generations, I implore all of you to look at the turf field and be proud. Proud that as a district and community, we have made the wise investment to showcase the pride we have of our student-athletes,  our marching band, and our community for generations to come.
