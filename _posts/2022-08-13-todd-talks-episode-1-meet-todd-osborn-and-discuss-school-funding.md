One of the big takeaways from our community survey was more information and transparency from our district leaders. As a step towards that, we are starting a new video short series called 'TODD Talks'.

Each episode of TODD Talks will feature one of the adminstrators in the Chippewa Local School District, letting you learn a bit more about them and having them discuss a hot topic for our district residents.

For our first episode, Chippewa Local Schools superintendent Todd Osborn talks about his career in education, family, what he likes most about the community, and talks about the 1% School District Income Tax and it's impact on our schools.
