Episode 4 of TODD Talks is here, where we talk to Chippewa Intermediate School (CIS) principal Jamie Zollinger about her background, the culture of kindness she has set at CIS, and the new opportunities available to students at CIS since moving from the previous Chippewa Middle School. Jamie is both an long tenured staff member in the district along with being a district resident, and shares her unique perspective on the value of the district community and how the students at CIS reflect the culture this community values.
