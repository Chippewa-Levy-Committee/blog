title: Investing in security to protect our students
---
We were recently asked about the security investments made by the district, which are an aspect of today's school needs to ensure our students can learn in a safe environment. Chippewa has been investing in a number of school security upgrades as part of it's [strategic plan](/blog/2022/09/27/todd-talks-episode-2-todd-osborn-discusses-the-district-s-strategic-plan.html), using both general funds as well as being agreesive on obtaining grants and having donations from outside organizations.

Here is a list of some of those investments in the past year:

- Upgrades to our school buses, including..
	- Cameras inside the bus while the vehicle is in operation.
    - Cameras outside the bus to photograph any passing cars when the red loading/unloading lights are activated.
	- Lights on the front bumper of buses to see children walking in front of the buses.
- Updated security cameras in all the school buildings.
- During the [September 13th School Board Meeting](https://www.the-daily-record.com/story/news/education/2022/09/13/chippewa-local-school-board-oks-measures-to-increase-security/69491188007/) two new crosswalk signals were approved to be added in front of Chippewa Jr./Sr. High School at South Portage Street and Franklin Drive, as well as a second set of security doors will be installed at Chippewa Intermediate School.

In addition, the school district funds a full-time School Resource Officer in collaboration with the Doylestown Police Department that serves across all the three buildings. This officer along with Chief of Police Casey Tester work with our staff and students in rediness training and activities; learn more about this from the [Chief Tester's address to the Board of Education earlier this year](http://www.chippewa.k12.oh.us/district/chief-tester%E2%80%99s-presentation-school-board-school-safety).

Continuing to fund security is made possible thanks to the support of the district residents, with funds coming from the 1% School District Income tax that is up for renewal as a part of it. Voting "YES" for renewal of the levy on November 8th will allow the district to continue focusing on not just the basic security needs, but those "above and beyond" to ensure our next generation is safe and secure our schools.
