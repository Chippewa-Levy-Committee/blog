We are doing a football squares fundraiser this fall to support the Chippewa Levy Committee. We will be doing football squares for three upcoming games...

- [Ohio State vs Notre Dame - September 3rd](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTdr9uGXG23hv1WcNKPhPp1m31732FPy8Oq4ye7nEBKkSTL-rcvtj-GPnd0qlLvo8DJewvyfcEvk_EX/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)
- [Cleveland Browns vs Pittsburgh Steelers - September 23](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTdr9uGXG23hv1WcNKPhPp1m31732FPy8Oq4ye7nEBKkSTL-rcvtj-GPnd0qlLvo8DJewvyfcEvk_EX/pubhtml?gid=1460834613&single=true)
- [Ohio State vs Penn State - October 23](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vTdr9uGXG23hv1WcNKPhPp1m31732FPy8Oq4ye7nEBKkSTL-rcvtj-GPnd0qlLvo8DJewvyfcEvk_EX/pubhtml?gid=593048577&single=true)

Squares are $10 each, with payouts for each quarter:

- $50 for the first quarter
- $75 for the second quarter
- $100 for the third quarter
- $125 for the final score

You can buy squares using our [donations] page, making a note in the description how many squares you wish to purchase and for which games; you can also specify specific squares which we will make a best effort of accomodiating. Deadline for sales of squares is 24 hours before gametime, and we will randomize the numbers shortly thereafter.

If you have any questions - feel free to [contact us](mailto:chippewalevy@gmail.com). Thank you again for your support!
