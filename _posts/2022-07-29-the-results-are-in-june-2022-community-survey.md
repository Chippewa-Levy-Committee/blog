We are excited to announce the results of the community survey done in June 2022 are in. We were thrilled to have had 229 respondants from across our district provide very candid, insightful, and actionable feedback on both the community and the school district. 

Key insights and recommendations from the survey are:

**1) Community growth and vibrancy is an issue**

- Respondents connect lack of local businesses to lack of growth and vibrancy in the community.
- Respondents would like to see leadership forward thinking and developing long term plans for a stronger community.
- Leadership should be more proactive in developing and communicating a strategic plan

**2) Communication and transparency are challenges**

- Communication and transparency generally rated as the biggest challenges across questions and groups.
- While Facebook has been cited as a primary source of information with respondents, there was considerable feedback to have more diversity in the methods of communication.
- Many respondents cited information that has been publicly debunked, meaning there is a fair amount of disinformation filling the communication void.
- Leadership should invest in ways to be more intentional with communication with district residents.

**3) Respondents generally love the community and the schools.**

- Generally the “small town feel” of the community is a draw for residents
- Respondents value the teachers and staff and the educational excellence provided.
- Leadership should continue to focus on the positive values and stories of the district and community

## Where do we go from here?

Survey data such as this can be quite valuable for gaining insights, and it is our intention to do so as we help educate and connect with our community. As the Chippewa Levy Committee is working towards the fall campaign, look for a few things to come:

- More videos and articles that better connect to our district residents.
- Developing out the [Resources][resources] page to contain links to key materials often requested by district residents.
- Telling and promoting the "good stories" of the district.

Look for this website to have more of these to come!
