#OneChippewa aims to serve the residents within the Chippewa Local Schools District, helping them understand the work being done and current issues the school district faces as it serves the students of our community. 

One thing we have found is there is great work going on around the district which is less visible but still quite impactful. If you have news on this work, we want to know. Some good ideas of items that would be great for this site include:

- Achievements or significant impacts made by current or former students that showcase the value and impact of Chippewa Local Schools.
- Insight into current school issues or community discussions impacting the Chippewa Local School District, such as security, academics, athletics, or buildings.
- Historical perspectives and insights on the Chippewa Local School District, such as profiles of former staff, looking back at past milestones and achievements, or telling the story of historical events and how they tie to the district today.

You don't need a fully written blog post; a rough draft or even a few bullet points is a great start, and we can help you craft it into a feature on this site.
