I'm sure by now you've seen the latest results from the [Ohio School Report Cards](https://reportcard.education.ohio.gov), where Chippewa Local Schools once again has acceled as a top school district in the county. In fact, Chippewa Local Schools was the only school district in Wayne County scoring a '5' in Achievement, Gap Closing, and Graduation. The chart below showcases how Chippewa fared compared to the other districts in Wayne County.

I encourage you to read this [informative article in the Wooster Daily Record](https://www.the-daily-record.com/story/news/education/2022/09/15/how-to-read-the-new-ohio-state-report-cards-for-schools/69494403007/) to better understand the results which have changed for 2021-2022 academic year. Also note that this past academic year was still one where the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted staff and students, so coming away with such high marks is even more remarkable.

Another part of the School Report Card speaks to [funding](https://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/district/finance/050534), and one aspect focuses on the operating costs per pupil.

Again Chippewa Local Schools shine, being the highest achieving school in the county with the lowest cost per pupil. If we expand to the full state, we see that Chippewa Local Schools showcases how efficent they are able to educate students.
