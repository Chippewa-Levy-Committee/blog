As voters in the district are well aware, we did not pass either school levy. It's a hard pill to swallow for sure, but one that gives us all pause. 

Shortly after the election, the levy committee did a post-mortem survey to try and understand with the smaller group on the execution and ways to improve. Here's what we learned.

## What worked well for this campaign?

Here's what we heard...

- Positive messaging
- Thorough Communication
- Leadership
- Visibility on social media
- Public meetings
- Participation in town events
- Hard work by volunteers
- Responsiveness to questions and concerns
- Visuals and signs created

One thing we tried to do during this campaign is stay forward thinking, while at the same time try to be as responsive in a constructive way to the questions. Myself personally I called several folks who had questions and concerns, which for many was the first time someone reached to them about thier concerns.

## What didn't work as well for this campaign?

Here's what we heard...

- Short timeframe / late start for the levy campaign
- Trying to pass two levies at once
- .5 mill levy being a permanent levy
- Not engaging enough of the district residents
- Transparency on past district decisions ( example: sports complex )

The big message here is we quite a hill to climb in a short period of time. Having two levy issues to pass at once made it complicated on the messaging, making the concerns on the .5 mill issue overshadow the 1% renewal issue. The committee didn't reach out as much as it could to the district residents, and having a lot of the information within Facebook made it hard to find. 

## What should the campaign have done that it didn't do?

Here's what we heard, outside the many respondants that indicated they weren't really sure...

- More outreach to the district residents and community groups through different mediums
- Talk more to risks of not passing the levy.
- Get better communication on district resident concerns.

Overall the big feedback is with more time, more can be done. There was also some feedback on getting more insight on district resident concerns.

## What feedback do you have regarding the Levy committee management, organization, and communication?

Generally residents were quite complimentary of the levy committee seeing the short time table we had. We were a new group of people getting involved for the first time, learning from the work of those who have done these campaigns before, so there were some learning curves. But having that expertise and support was invaluable and help us going forward.


Raw results of the post-mortem are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQByas172RbhJgXonFjdgTrcHgDl25-TbKga3ZxWIP41xas0tXp6Gouim5vT4lnDzknHj-3JMNHXNF4/pub?gid=1182646063&single=true&output=csv)

## What comes next?

While we wait to hear on the plans for running a levy issue for the fall, there are two immediate actions we are taking.

1) Starting this website, where we can speak more to the concerns and questions the community has.
2) Doing a community survey to get a better sense of the feedback and concerns of the district residents.

Look for more on both these topics in the coming weeks!
