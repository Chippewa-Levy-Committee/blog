As voters in the district are well aware, the school distruct did not pass either school levy. It's a hard pill to swallow for sure, but one that gives us all pause. Win or lose, there is always things to learn from this experience, and this post lays that out. 

The first step in trying to assess what went right, what didn't go as well, and what we could do in the future ( many refer to this as the start/stop/continue matrix ). Shortly after the election, the levy committee did a post-mortem survey to try and understand with the smaller group on the execution and ways to improve. Here's what we learned.

## What worked well for this campaign?

Here's what we heard...

- Positive messaging (50%)
- Thorough Communication (25%)
- Leadership (25%) 
- Visibility on social media (15%)
- Public meetings (15%)
- Participation in town events (5%)
- Hard work by volunteers (5%)
- Responsiveness to questions and concerns (5%)
- Visuals and signs created (5%)

One thing we tried to do during this campaign is stay forward thinking, while at the same time try to be as responsive in a constructive way to the questions. In this campaign we made it a point to have personal reachouts to those who raised questions and concerns, which for many was the first time someone reached to them about thier concerns. Being a small town those personal connections build trust and respect, and it was key for this campaign to stay true to that.

## What didn't work as well for this campaign?

Here's what we heard...

- Short timeframe / late start for the levy campaign (25%)
- Trying to pass two levies at once (25%)
- .5 mill levy being a permanent levy (10%)
- Not engaging enough of the district residents (15%)
- Transparency on past district decisions ( example: sports complex ) (15%)

The big message here is there was quite a hill to climb in a short period of time. Having two levy issues to pass at once made the messaging a bit convoluted, which in turn made the concerns on the .5 mill issue overshadow the 1% renewal issue. Additionally, relying too much on Facebook as the primary communication vehicle left many of our district residents out, and for those who did use Facebook it still was quite hard to find information because of all the noise created in the comments.

## What should the campaign have done that it didn't do?

Here's what we heard, outside the many respondants that indicated they weren't really sure (50%)...

- More outreach to the district residents and community groups through different mediums (15%)
- Talk more to risks of not passing the levy (15%)
- Get better communication on district resident concerns (20%)

Overall the big feedback is with more time, more can be done. There was also some respondants saying thaqt the committee needs to get more insight on district resident concerns, which aligns with the responses to the other two questions

## What feedback do you have regarding the Levy committee management, organization, and communication?

Generally respondants were quite complimentary of the levy committee seeing the short time table we had. We were a new group of people getting involved for the first time, learning from the work of those who have done these campaigns before, so there were some learning curves for sure. But having that expertise and support was invaluable to the work done and will help us going forward. 


Raw results of the post-mortem are available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQByas172RbhJgXonFjdgTrcHgDl25-TbKga3ZxWIP41xas0tXp6Gouim5vT4lnDzknHj-3JMNHXNF4/pub?gid=1182646063&single=true&output=csv)

## What comes next?

While we wait to hear on the plans for running a levy issue for the fall, there are two immediate actions we are taking.

1. Starting this website, where we can speak more to the concerns and questions the community has. If you have a topic we should cover, [email it to us](mailto:onechippewa@gmail.com).
2. Doing a community survey to get a better sense of the feedback and concerns of the district residents. 

Look for more on both these topics in the coming weeks!
