  "Letter: Support the Chippewa school tax issue as an investment in kids,
  community" - The Daily Record
---
Thank you to Emily Conyers for her heartfelt letter to the editor supporting the renewal of the 1% School District Income Tax. This quote really sums it up…

“Many people who grow up in Doylestown choose to stay and raise their families here. There are many reasons for that, mostly tied to people loving the small-town type of community. However, it also speaks to the positive experiences that people have had attending Chippewa Local Schools. They remember the excellent teachers, the engaging curriculum, and the plentiful extra curriculars. People want to ensure that their children have the same opportunities to learn and grow.”
