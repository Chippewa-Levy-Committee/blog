One thing seen commonly as a question in both the [community survey](https://survey.onechippewa.org) as well as Facebook is about adminstration and school board salaries. This is an often cited as a question, such as "Why does the superintentent make so much?" or "Maybe the board should take a salary cut".

Let's look at each of the salaries seperately for School Board Members and Adminstration leadership.

## School Board Member salaries

There's a great document put out by [ohioschoolboards.org](https://www.ohioschoolboards.org/sites/default/files/OSBABoardCompensationFactSheet.pdf) which spells out the exact statutes that govern school board member salaries.

> Under the statute, board members may be compensated for their service up 
to $125 per meeting (Ohio Revised Code Section (RC) 3313.12, 3311.19). Boards 
are not required to pay the statutory maximum but may choose to compensate 
at any rate up to the statutory maximum. The statute also provides that all 
board members except for joint vocational board members are prohibited from 
receiving more than $5,000 per year in total compensation (RC 3313.12).

So net-net, board members make $125 per official school board meeting. In [2021 there were 25 official school board meetings](http://www.chippewa.k12.oh.us/district/board-meeting-agendas-audio), so that would be $3,125 per school board member, and $15,625 in total compensation to the school board ( which accounts for [0.12% of the annual budget](http://www.chippewa.k12.oh.us/district/content-page/treasurer) )

Often school board members will participate in a number of school activities, such as graduation, open houses, or other special events, and for each of these there is no compensation. Similarly school board members spend time communicating with district residents who reach out to them which is also not compensated for.

## Superintendent salary

The current Chippewa Local School District Superintendent, Todd Osborn, makes [$122,500 annually on a four-year contract from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2022](http://www.chippewa.k12.oh.us/sites/chippewa.k12.oh.us/files/Chippewa%20BOE%20Regular%20Meeting%20-%207-9-18.pdf). This salary accounts for [1% of the annual budget](http://www.chippewa.k12.oh.us/district/content-page/treasurer) )

Here is where that stands in comparision to other area Superintendents ( data source is https://www.buckeyeinstitute.org/data/teacher_salary with data from 2019 )...
