The common thinking is athletics are a distraction at worst and indifferent at best to academics, but if you [look at the data](https://news.ku.edu/2014/01/15/study-shows-high-school-athletes-performed-better-school-persisted-graduation-more-non), the student-athletes actually have higher GPAs, higher graduation rates, and generally add more to the economy when they graduate compared to non-student-athletes. So how can we as a district leverage that?

The answer lies in events such as "Reading Under the Lights", which happened last night at the stadium. This event brought together our student-athletes, band, and teachers to engage with our younger students in reading and learning opportunities. What better way to help grow the next-generation than have the current generation become role models to them.

Making events like this possible is the support of our district residents thru the 1% School District Income Tax, which is up for renewal on November 8th. We already are a district that does more with less, having the lowest operating costs per pupil yet highest academic achievement in Wayne County; renewing this levy means continuing that investment so that the students who attended last night can grow up to become those students reading to the generation coming up next.
