We've seen a fair amount of discussion around the turf that was
installed in the stadium in the park that is owned by the Chippewa Local
Schools and used by the Chippewa football and soccer teams, along with
several other groups. We've researched to help answer one of the key
questions in district residents\' minds - how the turf was funded.

## State of the field before the turf

To best understand the funding question, one must consider the field\'s
state in the mid-2010s. In short, it wasn't good. We saw in a previous
post [that football and soccer tournament games dating back to the late
1990s had to be moved to different
facilities](file:////blog/2022/09/30/why-quality-athletic-facilities-benefit-our-students-and-community.html),
which was an additional expense for the district and a loss of revenue.
Suppose you combine the costs of field rental, transportation, and the
loss of revenue. In that case, it's fair to say there was a negative
economic impact of around \$3,000 for every event held at a different
facility. With at least 20 events impacted, we are talking \$60,000 of
total negative economic impact in total.

Repairing the field so it could be used safely required a significant
investment, as the drainage system underneath the field has completely
failed. Because it had failed, it was damaging other areas of the park
with the excess water runoff. Repair required a complete excavation,
estimated at around \$500,000, including replanting the field with
grass.

## Justifying the turf investment

The district and community saw that even with the repairs, the facility
would be unusable in the winter and early spring, where even a
well-drained field would still be wet and prone to damage requiring
re-sodding. Replacing the field with artificial turf, which the current
technology is low maintenance and generally considered safer, only would
cost the district an additional \$200,000. Re-couping the cost
difference isn't hard to see; let's look at the yearly upkeep costs for
the grass field.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Let's assume that our soccer and football teams have one game where a
grass field would have to be relocated but a turf field would not,
bringing the economic impact annually to \$25,500.

**It would take approximately eight years to recoup the investment.**
Considering the lifespan of such fields is typically ten years or more,
the district would be \$50,000 ahead by the ten-year mark.

## Community support and donations for facilities

The Chippewa Athletic Boosters started a [Chippewa 500
Club](https://www.the-daily-record.com/story/news/2019/06/13/chippewa-promoting-fundraising-moving-ahead/4920311007/)
to be able to fund facility improvements from private donations. To
date, the Chippewa Athletic Boosters have raised \$60,000, which has
gone into projects such as repairs to the concession stand and ticket
booth at the Doylestown Memorial Park Stadium, a backstop for the new
Softball field at the JR/SR High School. This doesn't account for time
spent by volunteers or in-kind donations for the work invested into the
facilities.

The School Board saw the community commitment and funded the turf field,
understanding that funding through the Chippewa 500 Club would
supplement the investment. While that fundraising hasn't raised the
entire gap of \$200,000, that \$60,000 has offset other facilities
investments for the district.

**The \$60,000 raised means the district would be approximately
\$110,000 ahead at the ten-year mark.**

## Additional opportunities that come with the turf field

One thing not counted here is the impact on other programs and uses of a
turf field vs. a grass field. Here's a small list of the programs that
can use this field...

-   Chippewa Youth Football and Cheerleading
-   "Reading under the Lights" annual literacy program
-   Spring sports such as baseball and softball for practices
-   Marching band

These additional events and activities at the field bring people into
Doylestown. Those people visit our local businesses while here, bringing
additional economic impact to the community.

## Summary

The district indeed paid for the field - in full - using funds from the
general fund. It's also true that the district must fund all its
facility upkeep, whether it has donations to subsidize those
investments. If one looks at the numbers presented, the district saw the
field turf as a prudent investment considering the required repairs.

The numbers presented showcase that the investment pays off over ten
years with no further use of the field outside of football and soccer.
But new facilities bring new opportunities, and the turf investment has
enabled new usages of the field, which benefit the district and the
community as a whole.
