title: 'TODD Talks - Episode 8: Carl Dulin'
---
We've extended our first season of TODD Talks with a special bonus episode., interviewing Carl Dulin. Carl has been a member of this community for decades as a teacher, coach, former board member, and preacher, and he has impacted the lives of many in this community. Carl speaks about how he has seen the community and district evolve over the decades and tells the story of Paul Stanley, who saved the school district in 1974. He then gives an impassioned perspective on how voting for the levy is about doing right by our kids.
