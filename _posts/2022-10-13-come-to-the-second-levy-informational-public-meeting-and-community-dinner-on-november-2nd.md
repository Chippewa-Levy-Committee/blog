We are excited to announce that our second Levy Informational Public Meeting will be held on Wednesday, November 2nd, 2022 at 5:30 pm in the Chippewa JR/SR High School cafeteria. At 5:30 pm, the Chippewa staff and students will serve a free spaghetti dinner to district residents, followed by a program starting at 6:30 pm which will briefly cover the levy issues, talk with staff and students in the schools about thier experiences, and have time to answer questions from the audience.

We again will simulcast the event on Zoom ( https://zoom.us/j/95422086801 ) as well as through Facebook Live thanks to [Doylestown Thrive](https://www.facebook.com/DoylestownThrive). Child care will also be available thanks to the student's of the Chippewa Senior High School's National Honor Society. 

We look forward to having district residents come and have dinner with us, and learn more about the impact the 1% School District Income Tax has had on our schools.
