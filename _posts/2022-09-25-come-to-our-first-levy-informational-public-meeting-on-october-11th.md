As we are getting closer to election day, we will be holding two public meetings to help our district residents better understand how the 1% School District Income Tax impacts our schools, students, and community.

The first of the two public meetings will be held on **Tuesday, October 11th, 2022 at 6:30 pm in the Chippewa JR/SR High School auditorium**. We will do a presentation on the levy and it's impact, and then answer questions from attendees.

If you can't join us in person, you can join virtually via Zoom ( [https://zoom.us/j/95745046351](https://zoom.us/j/95745046351) ). We will also have childcare available onsite. Looking forward to connecting with district residents there.

Our second public meeting will be held on **Wednesday, November 2nd, 2022 at 6:30 pm in the Chippewa JR/SR High School auditorium**. More details to come.
