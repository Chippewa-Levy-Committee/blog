title: How the turf was funded
---
We've seen a fair amount of discussion around the turf that was installed in the stadium in the park that is owed by the Chippewa Local Schools and used by the Chippewa footbal and soccer teams, along with several other groups. We've done some research to help answer one of the key questions in district residents minds - how the turf was funded.

## State of the field before the turg

To best understand the funding question, one has to consider what the state of the field was in the mid-2010s. In short, it wasn't good. We saw in a previous post [that football and soccer tournament games dating back to the late 1990s had to be moved to different facilities](/blog/2022/09/30/why-quality-athletic-facilities-benefit-our-students-and-community.html), which not only was an additional expense for the district, but also meant a loss of revenue for the district. If you combine the costs of field rental, transportation, and the loss of revenue, it's fair to say there was a negative economic impact of around $3,000 for every event impacts. With at least 20 events impacted, we are talking $60,000 of total negative economic impact in total.

To repair the field so it could be used safely required a significant investment, as the drainage system that is underneath the field has completely failed. Because it had failed, it was damaging other areas of the park with the excess water runoff. To repair required a complete excavation, which the cost estimates at the time were around $500,000, which included replanting the field with grass.

## Justifying the turf investment

The district and community saw how that even with the repairs, the facility wouldn't be able to used in the winter and early spring where even a well drained field would still be wet and prone to damage requiring re-sodding. Replacing the filed with artifical turf, which the current technology is low maintenance and generally considered safer, only would cost the district an additional $200,000. Re-couping the cost difference isn't hard to see; let's look at the costs of yearly upkeep for the grass field.

| Mowing ( weekly May through October at $200 cost per mowing ) | $5,000 |
| Football game prep ( field lining and prep, $500 per game, assumes 5 home games ) | $2,500 |
| Soccer game prep ( field lining and prep, $500 per game, assumes 20 home games ) | $10,000 |
| Other Repairs ( sod/reseeding, fertilizer ) | $5,000 |
| **Total annual cost to maintain** | **$22,500** |

Let's assume between our soccer and football team, we have one game where with a grass field would have to relocated but with a turf field would not, that brings the economic impact annually to $25,500.

**To recoup the investment, it would take approximately 8 years.** Considering the lifespan of such fields are typically 10 years or more, by the **10 year mark the district would be $50,000 ahead**.

## Community support and donations for facilities

The Chippewa Athletic Boosters started a [Chippewa 500 Club](https://www.the-daily-record.com/story/news/2019/06/13/chippewa-promoting-fundraising-moving-ahead/4920311007/) with the intention of being able to fund facility improvements from private donations. To date, the Chippewa Athletic Boosters have raised $60,000, which has went into projects such as repairs to the concession stand and ticket booth at the Doylestown Memorial Park Stadium, a backstop for the new Softball field at the JR/SR High School. This doesn't account for time spent by volunteers or in-kind donations for the work invested into the facilities.

The School Board saw the community commitment and funded the turf field with the understanding that funding through the Chippewa 500 Club would suppliment the investment. While that fundraising hasn't raised the full gap of $200,000, that $60,000 has offset other facilities investments for the district.

**If we take into account the $60,000 raised, this means at the 10 year mark the district would be approximately $110,000 ahead.**

## Additional opportunites that come with the turf field

One thing not counted here is impact on additional programs and uses of a turf field vs a grass field. Here's just a small list of the programs now able to use this field...

- Chippewa Youth Football and Cheerleading
- "Reading under the Lights" annual literacy program
- Spring sports such as baseball and softball for practices
- Marching band

With these additional events and activities at the field, it brings people into Doylestown. Those people visit our local businesses while they are here, which brings additional economic impact on the community as a whole.

## Summary

It's true that the district paid for the field - in full - using funds from the general fund. It's also true that the district has to fund all of it's facility upkeep, whether or not it has donations to subsidize those investments. If one looks at the numbers presented, the district saw the field turf at that point in time a prudent investment considering the needed repairs that were required. 

The numbers presented showcase that with no additional use of the field outside of football and soccer, the investment pays off over the course of 10 years. But with such a facilities new uses open up, with both benefits to the district as well as for the community.
