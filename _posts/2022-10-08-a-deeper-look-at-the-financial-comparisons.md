title: A deeper look at the financial comparisons
---

As we are all heading into uncertain economic times, there is a tendency to do "belt tightening" to manage the short-term. I came across an [article on the short-term negative impact of failed school levies](https://sunnysideofcbus.com/2018/04/23/how-failed-school-levies-affect-property-value/), which reinforced the need to continue funding schools. But to be fair, many in our district don't see how low cost that investment is to each of us as district residents. So let's take a look at some fact and figures.

First, let's look again at the 2021-2022 Expenditures Per Pupil, as reported on the 2022 Ohio School Report Cards. Total Number of Students in District is 1,223.

| District                                           | Expenditures |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Southeast                                          | $13,403      |
| Triway                                             | $12,616      |
| Rittman                                            | $12,102      |
| Orrville                                           | $11,662      |
| Wooster                                            | $11,409      |
| Dalton                                             | $11,346      |
| Green                                              | $10,695      |
| Northwestern                                       | $10,525      |
| Norwayne                                           | $10,142      |
| **Chippewa**                                       | **$9,863**   |

To give a sense of comparision, in Ohio the average expenditure per pupil is $11,246, and in Wayne County it's slightly higher at $11,376. Not only is Chippewa spending the least amount of money per pupil in Wayne County, it's over 12% under the state and local average, and only 1 of 4 county schools that spend less than the state average.	

If we look specifically on the funding brought in by the School District Income Tax which is up for renewal, it provides the school district about $2.2 million, or 15% of it's annual revenue. If the income tax would be non-renewed, this would lower our per pupil expenditures to approximately to $8,064. Not only would this be significantly lower than the state average and 
the county average, but only [one school district in Ohio is that low](https://reportcard.education.ohio.gov/district/finance/049668), and they aren't in the top 20% in academic performance index.

Next is looking at the tax burden on each of us. If we look at a household with a district median household (earned) income of $66,750 ( based on the 2020 U.S. Census data ) and who own a home valued at $200,000, we see Chippewa at the bottom end of other county districts.

| District     | Per Month Cost |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Wooster      | $254.99        |
| Green        | $225.44        |
| Orrville     | $217.11        |
| Northwestern | $215.38        |
| Triway       | $199.29        |
| Rittman      | $198.60        |
| Dalton       | $196.93        |
| **Chippewa** | **$192.29**    |
| Norwayne     | $191.77        |
| Southeast    | $153.67        |

The cost to support our schools, taking into account the current income tax and voted-in mileage (including the State of Ohio's base mileage of 20 mil) is lower than 7 other county schools and is comprobable to Norwayne.  

For retirees, this number is much more favorable. Looking at a household with a retirement income of $66,750 ( median based on 2020 U.S. Census Data, and includes pensions, IRA distributions, captial gains, annuities, etc.) and who own a home valued at $200,000, we see Chippewa a bargain investment.

| District     | Per Month Cost |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Wooster      | $254.99        |
| Orrville     | $217.11        |
| Northwestern | $215.38        |
| Triway       | $199.29        |
| Rittman      | $198.60        |
| Green        | $197.63        |
| Dalton       | $196.93        |
| Southeast    | $153.67        |
| Norwayne     | $150.05        |
| **Chippewa** | **$136.67**    |

The distirct is the most economical to support for any retiree to support as Chippewa has the lowest millage rate of any county school and since only earned income is taxed. It also points out the tax burden created by the School District Income Tax monthly for household with a $66,750 median income - only $55 per month.

Our district has been fortunate to have the investment of the community and has been responsible with it's spending as a result, even reducing millage in past years. The district has used this investment and made Chippewa a top school in Wayne County, Ohio, and the nation overall. Vote "YES" on November 8th to show your support for ensuring our schools remaining the shining star and something other districts look to as an example of success.
