Episode 3 of TODD Talks is here, where we talk with Ira Hamman about our school buildings and how permanent improvement funding is used to maintain our buildings and infrastructure. He will talk about the history of PI funding in the district, addressing the status of the NEXUS funding in court, touching how the district has remained prudent in it's spending after not renewing a 1.9 mill levy a few years ago to decrease the tax burden on our district residents.
